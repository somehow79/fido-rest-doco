                        <p>The API is a REST-based API for communicating with the IdentityX system. It has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate errors. For error conditions, more specific IdentityX error codes are also included to give more information about the error. All responses from the API are in JSON format. These REST services are secured by digest authentication to guarantee authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation of the messages transferred. Daon supplies Java and JavaScript SDKs which wrap the digest generation and the specifics of calling the REST services and present a language-specific interface for relying party developers to use in developing their applications. The REST API is provided for relying parties to interact with the IdentityX FIDO UAF v1.0 functionality and supports all FIDO operations; Registration, Authentication, Transaction Confirmation, and Deregistration. The API also exposes the same capabilities as the SOAP operations in the existing Admin and Service Provider Gateways. </p>

                            <p>In IdentityX, the URL specifies the tenant that the request relates to, or the system if the request is at a system level. This tenant is indicated by a sub-domain on the URL of the system. Examples:
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            </p>
                            <p>The following sample base URL is used in the sections below:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <url>https://tenant.domain.com/IdentityXServices/rest/v1</url>
                                    </li>

                                All entities in IdentityX have an ID and a HREF. Generally the HREF is used in IdentityX to identify the entities. This HREF provides the base URL plus the entity type, such as users, authenticationRequests or applications, and the unique identifier of the entity (the ID). For example, a HREF for a sample user might be:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>

                            <p>Requests to the IdentityX REST API are required to be signed. This signing is used to provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation. The messages are signed by attaching a HMAC to each request. This HMAC is generated by a token which has been issued to the client by the server.The HMAC is calculated over the body of the request as well as HTTP headers and also includes a nonce and timestamp to prevent replay attacks. Daon supplies SDKs in Java and Javascript which do this signing process. The IdentityX services add a HMAC to the REST responses as well and the client can verify that this matches the HMAC calculated on the response with the client’s shared secret. The signing process is also detailed in the following document if a developer wants to develop their own solution: </p>

                            <p>You can search for a specific resource or resources within a resource collection by using certain query parameters to specify search criteria. Searching is case insensitive and supports an asterisk (*) as a wildcard. Searches are treated as exact (case insensitive) matches if the wildcard is not used. The searchable query parameter(s) are documented on a per operation basis.</p>
                            <p>Some searches can also be filtered by status using the optional status query parameter. By default resources with any status are returned. If this parameter is included though, then the resources returned can be limited to a particular status such as ACTIVE or ARCHIVED (see individual operations for allowable values).</p>

                            <p>All top-level IdentityX API resources have support for “list” API methods which return multiple resources in one call. For example, ‘all users with a userId starting with Steve’ or ‘all authentication requests involving a specific user’. These API methods return a Collection Resource, which is a resource containing an array of other resources such as users or applications. A request may return a large number of resources, so pagination is used to break up the results into one or more pages. </p>
                            <p>The metadata attribute of a Collection Resource contains information such as the total count of resources in the collection, the current page and limit per page. The paging attribute has links to the first, previous, next and last pages in the collection. These links will be null if they represent the current page, such that if the current page is the first page then the first and previous links will be null (much as the first and previous buttons on a UI would be disabled in this case). Likewise, the next and last links will point to the appropriate pages assuming there are multiple pages in the collection.</p>

                            <p>A request for a collection resource can contain optional <i>sortField</i> and <i>sortAscending</i> parameters:</p>

                            <p>Many IdentityX resources are related to other resources and contain links to them in their response properties. A link property is a nested object that contains a href attribute which is the fully qualified location URI of the linked resource. For example, a registration has an associated application and user, and the JSON representation of a registration would contain two link properties such as in the example below:</p>

                            <p>The two links above are referred to as Instance links, as they refer to a specific instance of another resource. The other type of link is a Collection link which is the location of a related collection of resources, for example, the authentication requests related to a specific user. In this scenario, the user representation below would have an <i>authenticationRequests</i> link attribute:</p>

                            <p>When retrieving a resource with the IdentityX API, you can request that the server return not only that resource but also one or more of its related (linked) resources. For example, when requesting a registration, you can get back its associated application and user at the same time to save on having to issue multiple separate requests. Expansion is requested via the expand query parameter with the value being a URL-encoded (and preferably minified) JSON object. The syntax is slightly different depending on whether you are expanding links in a single instance (on a ‘get’) or in a collection (on a ‘list’).</p>
                            <h2>9.1 Expansion when requesting a single resource</h2>
                            <p>When expanding items in a single resource (for example, single registration,
                                <url>https://tenant.domain.com/IdentityXServices/rest/v1/registrations/QTAzN9Yht3IL-Q714vX0tJyMgA</url>), both instance links and collection links can be expanded. When expanding a collection link you can request a certain page or change the number of items returned using the page and limit attributes respectively. These attributes are not applicable when expanding an instance link.</p>

                            <p>The example below is for expanding a registration resource.

To expand the related user and authentication requests (but not application) while changing the default page size to 40, the following JSON object could be used:</p>

When a collection is requested, the items themselves are expanded by default. This can be changed by changing the expand attribute of items below to false, which would result in a list of resources with just a href being returned.</p>

This is primarily to be used as an aid to application developers in determining whether certain buttons on a user interface should be enabled. For example, if the user has permission to list applications but is not allowed to create a new application then the create application button could be disabled, rather than allowing a user to create it and then get a permissions error on submission. To include this information in any GET request, a query parameter called <i>includeAuthorizationInfo</i> should be set to true in the request. This will result in an attribute called <i>allowedPermissions</i> being returned which is a comma delimited list of permissions the user has on that specific resource.</p>
